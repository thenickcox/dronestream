## 0.2.3 (June 7, 2013)

* This version contains *breaking changes* from the previous version, and allows method chaining. The return value of all queries is different from previous versions, and the interface is completely different. Version 0.2.3 effectively deprecates all previous versions. 

## 0.1.1 (June 4, 2013)

* Fix bug in `with_child_casualties`. That method now correctly returns an array, rather than throwing an error.

## 0.1.0 (June 2, 2013)

* Version bump. Implemented more methods.

## 0.0.1 (June 2, 2013)

* Initial release. Support for `#in_country` and `#with_civilian_casualties` methods only.

## Other versions?

You may notice that the versions are not as predictably sequential as you would think (e.g., 0.1.1 to 0.2.3). I had some issues with a few builds that I had to yank from rubygems.com, and had to use diffrent version names.
